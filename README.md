## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first stab at creating a full page layout using CSS grid and Flexbox. My biggest learning was to take a few minutes before starting to code and plan out the design of the page (i.e. Will I use Grid or Flexbox? Where will I need to place these display properties? How will that impact my HTML structure?). It saved me so much time and confusion down the road. 

### Continued development

While my design matches pretty closely with the desktop and mobile Figma designs provided, I really need to work on adding tablet breakpoints into my next project. At these sizes the review section (with the 5-star selling points) in my mock-up looks messy. 

### Useful resources

- [Centering using max-width and auto margins](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/snippets/design/centering-your-website-using-max-width-and-auto-margins#:~:text=The%20max%2Dwidth%20does%20exactly,what%20actually%20centers%20the%20content) - After setting max-width on some elements, it took me such a long time to pinpoint why my elements weren't centering. This strategy helped fix my problem.
- [Transform CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) - Staggering the review and testimonials elements (on larger screens) was a new challenge for me. This resource helped me find a solution.
